Operation:
  Application for assigning gift reciever's in Secret Santa.

  Takes a return separated list of names and randomly assigns each one
  to another name in the list (not their own). Creates a text file
  for each name with the person they are giving to inside so that the 
  generating person does not have the fun spoiled.

Future implementation:
  - Take in email addresses as well and send the emails automatically.
    ~ Probably best implemented by space separating name and email
